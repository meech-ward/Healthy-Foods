In a time that there has been a planetary diet suggested by 37 scientists throughout the world, to save the planet, by eating less meat and cutting down on agriculture, we would like to look at food waste, which is a significant factor on this planet today.The UN food and agricultural organisation state that a third of all food produced is wasted.
Food loss is where production or harvests are faulty, not being able to reach the standards of the supermarkets, for example a ton of bananas which have brown spots on them will be thrown away, if a sell by date has been put on a product incorrectly that will be food loss.

Food waste is the big issue in industrialised countries. It is mainly due to retailers and consumers throwing perfectly edible food into the bin. 
What can we as individuals  do to stop this horrendous waste?
Stop throwing perfectly good food away.The best before date, sometimes shown as BBE (best before end), is about quality and not safety, it is a GUIDE. Do not throw food away that says best before the date but is perfectly fine to eat. The food will be safe to eat after this date but may not be at its best.  Use by date is about safety, often found on meats, dairy and fish. You should eat these by the use by date or very soon after. If you are not going to eat it, don’t buy it. Use leftovers for lunch the next day. Use vegetable peelings, stalks and outside leaves for soup stock, or composting.  Make bread pudding with stale bread, peel over ripe bananas and freeze them, they make a fabulous smoothie, just add milk and blend. Any veggies that have been stored a little long and need to be eaten soon, cook and make a soup, then freeze if you don’t want it yet. Do your best to stop the waste in your home.
