### Ingredients: 

* 300 ml. groundnut or avocado oil
* 2 egg yolks
* 1 garlic clove, crushed (optional)
* 1 heaped tsp powdered mustard or paste
* 1 level tsp salt
* freshly milled black pepper
* 1 tsp white wine vinegar or lemon juice

### Method:

Place the egg yolks into a bowl, add the crushed garlic, salt, freshly milled black pepper and the mustard powder. Mix all of these together well with a hand whisk or electric whisk then, holding the groundnut oil in a jug in one hand and an electric hand whisk in the other, add 1 drop of oil to the egg mixture and whisk this in.The key to a successful mayonnaise is making sure each drop of oil is thoroughly whisked in before adding the next drop. Once you've added about half of the groundnut oil, the mixture will begin to thicken and then you add the vinegar or lemon juice.Now you can add the remaining groundnut oil in larger drops. You can then begin pouring the olive oil in a very, very thin but steady stream, keeping the beaters going all the time. When all the oil has been added, the mayonnaise is ready. Store in a jar in the fridge.
