This goes really well as an accompaniment to a meal, or add nuts and egg as a complete meal. Change up red cabbage for green and experiment with ingredients of your choice (radish, celeriac, apple etc.)

### Ingredients

* Red cabbage
* Carrots
* Raw beetroot
* Celery

### Directions

Grate equal amounts of cabbage and carrots. Add Â¼ of the amount of grated raw beetroot and celery, add seasoning, extra virgin olive oil and homemade mayonnaise to taste. Can also add pine nuts, walnuts.
This will keep in an airtight container for a few days, just stir and save. It will last longer if you just sprinkle with lemon juice and put the dressing on each time you eat it.
