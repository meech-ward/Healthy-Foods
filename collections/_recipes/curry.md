When I was living in Malaysia, my Mum would go to the market most days to buy fresh spices for the delicious curries she made. Those spices have so many health benefits! Curry has become a staple diet in the UK, in my little town of roughly 27,000, we have 4 Indian restaurants. It is a great meal whatever season you are in and is so versatile as it keeps for a week in the fridge, infact, I believe it tastes better after a day or two!

#### Ingredients 

Feeds 4

* 1 onion
* 4cm piece of ginger
* 2 cloves of garlic
* olive oil
* Make a [tikka masala paste](/recipes/tika-masala-paste) or use 2 tablespoons of bought tikka masala paste
* 3 tablespoons natural yoghurt
* 2 tablespoons tomato pur√©e
* 8 skinless free-range chicken thighs or fish or vegetables of your choice.
* 1 x 400 g jar of chopped tomatoes or cook your own from fresh, removing the skins
* 1 x 400 g jar of  coconut milk
* 2 handfuls of baby spinach (optional)
* 1 tablespoon of coconut or maple sugar.

### Directions

Fry the onions and garlic on a medium heat for 15 minutes, until caramelised. Fry the veg, meat or fish, until cooked through, that you are using and set aside. Add the tomatoes, tomato puree and tikka masala paste to the onion and garlic, stir in some stock or hot water, until you have a thick soup like consistency. Leave to simmer for  40 minutes. Add coconut milk, spinach, maple sugar, vegetables, meat or fish  and cook for a further 5-10  minutes. If you would like to add yoghourt before you serve, that is good, or serve with a yoghourt and cucumber raita.
