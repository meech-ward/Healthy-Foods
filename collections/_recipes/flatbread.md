* Equal amounts of Almond flour and potato starch flour,  
* 1egg and liquid (Any type of organic milk, almond, coconut,etc, (add another egg if making a bigger amount) 
* Stir in the egg and milk to the flours until all lumps have gone. 
* Make it as thick or runny as you prefer. Thicker(like a very thick batter mix) for naan type breads, thinner (like a thick pancake mix) for wraps. (experiment for best results)
* Either lightly fry in coconut oil, or place on greased baking sheet and grill or bake, until lightly brown on both sides. 

You can use this as a pizza base, by making it even thicker.

You can add cheese and onion, garlic, tomato  to these for a more savoury bread. 
For a sweet bread, add blueberries, cinnamon and a dash of honey. Serve with coconut cream.
