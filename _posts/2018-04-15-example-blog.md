ADHD and ADD

When I was teaching in the US I was horrified at how many of my students had been prescribed ritalin for their hyperactivity or attention deficit….this drug has been classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule II narcotic—the same classification as cocaine, morphine and amphetamines. It’s possible side effects can be nervousness, insomnia, anorexia, loss of appetite, pulse changes, heart problems and weight loss. The manufacturer says it is a drug of dependency. Don’t you think that this should be a last resort drug after at least trying some dietary changes and supplements? In the UK over the past 10 Years the use of Ritalin and other ‘smart drugs’ has doubled. Almost 1.5 million prescriptions were dispensed by the NHS last year. Could this be that the increase in diagnoses has anything to do with the  foods our children are eating, which over the years are becoming more and more processed. My son, now aged 26 showed many signs of hyperactivity and attention deficit from the age of 2. I cut out all sugar and processed foods from his diet and introduced a high quality fish oil daily as well as a child’s probiotic. The probiotic is to make his tummy healthy and be ready to absorb all the fabulous nutrients. I made sure he had plenty of fresh air, burning off extra energy outdoors.This was enough to notice a huge difference in him. As he grew up into a teen, we had the help of a herbalist who introduced, a mix of gotu kola, pine bark and passion flower. Now as an adult, he has developed strategies to deal with the attention deficit, while continuing to eat a nutrient dense diet loaded with good fats. A study published in the British medical journal The Lancet indicated that in at least 2/3 of all ADHD cases, food sensitivities were the cause.
That’s a lot of kids  being dosed with toxic pharmaceutical drugs to treat ADHD who simply don’t need them! This number is colossal. In the U.S. alone, that represents an estimated 5 million children. The researchers from The Netherlands who discovered this, Dr. Lidy Pelsser and Professor Jan Buitelaar said;
"We think that dietary intervention should be considered in all children with ADHD. This, provided that parents are willing to follow a diagnostic restricted elimination diet for a 5-week period, and that expert supervision is available," 
So what are the food that have been shown to possibly cause and aggravate ADHD? Sugar, food additives and colours (read the labels of everything you buy). All processed foods (Anything in a tin or foods with a really long shelf life), some researchers believe fluoride can aggravate it too.
REMEDY  Cut out all processed foods eg bacon, sugar, sweeteners and foods from your child’s diet. Give them a high quality fish oil supplement daily as well as eating a diet high in healthy fats, proteins and vegetables. A magnesium supplement has shown to also have a calming effect and help with sleep. 
These were the types of meals I gave my son which improved his symptoms of ADD remarkably: I used organic ingredients where possible, butter and milk from grass fed cows, or coconut milk. I made sure my oils were cold pressed, extra virgin and organic.

Breakfast:
1. 2 eggs cooked any way from pasture raised hens with an avocado or organic toast. (some ADHD children have a sensitivity to gluten, so avoid bread if this is the case.) I have a fabulous recipe for gluten free Flatbreads (recipe) which I will share with you on the recipes page and only take 5 minutes to make and 5 minutes to cook.
2. Pancakes made with chestnut flour, egg and milk,(recipe) topped with berries and full fat organic yoghourt from coconut or grass fed cows.
3. Oatmeal with berries and sesame seeds, walnuts, add 1 oz. butter or coconut oil.
Drink: water and take high quality fish oil with breakfast.
Lunches:
1.Free range chicken with salad and  sweet potatoes. Pour extra virgin olive oil or extra virgin avocado oil over salad. With salt and pepper and lemon juice, or make homemade Mayonnaise (recipe)
2. Organic feta cheese with home made coleslaw(recipe) and flat bread.
3. Homemade cauliflower cheese, topped with tomatoes,(recipe) served with flatbread sprinkled with extra virgin olive oil.
Drink: water
Dinner:
1.Oily Fish, lightly fried with coconut oil or grilled, with sweet potatoes, leafy green vegetables, tomatoes, broccoli spears, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil.
2. Stir fry (coconut oil) of fish or chicken with bean sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, peppers, onions and garlic, with organic rice.
3. Pizza made with flatbread base, organic mozzarella and toppings of choice drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and served with veg or salad.
For desserts, I offered raw or cooked fruit with a sprinkle of coconut sugar or maple syrup, raw date and nut bars or almond flour cake. (recipe)
Drink: Water or sparkling water with a squeeze of fresh fruit.

NOTE: If your child is on medication for ADD or ADHD , consult with their doctor first about weaning them off these and substituting with nutrients and supplements.

# SUGAR is the main cause of illness in the western world. Why? It causes excess acid in the body. For those of you with heartburn or digestive issues, have you ever noticed how much worse it becomes after eating or drinking sugary foods or drinks?  If you can cut sugar out of your diet, you will lead a far healthier life. Nobody said life was easy and giving up sugar can be a nightmare, but it will be so worth it!  Sugar causes inflammation and disease thrives on inflammation. We know it can be really hard for some of you who are eating and drinking a lot of sugar, but start by cutting down, until you have cut it out completely. It is remarkable how much better you will feel! If you have been eating and drinking a lot of sugar for many years, you are not going to feel better immediately you give up, you will probably feel pretty bad until it is completely out of your system. It might take a few weeks,before you feel a lot better, but stick with it! See the big picture!
“Sugar’s not dangerous because of its calories, or because it makes you fat. Sugar is dangerous because it’s sugar. It’s not nutrition. When consumed in excess, it’s a toxin. And it’s addictive” Dr. Robert Lustig
Research shows that 40% of money spent on healthcare in the US alone are related to eating too much sugar. In the UK,  Obesity costs the NHS an estimated £5.1bn a year, research suggest that the rest of Europe is similar. Consuming too much sugar through your diet is closely associated with becoming overweight. That in turn increases the risk of some of the western world’s biggest killers: heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and certain cancers.  
 If you cut out sugar, inflammation will decrease. Not only that, but you will stop feeling tired from sugar crashes, your skin and hair will look better, you will sleep better.  But DON’T reach for the awful sweeteners, such as 
Saccharin – Sweet’N Low, Sweet Twin, and Necta Sweet
Aspartame – Equal and NutraSweet
Acesulfame K – also in Equal and NutraSweet
Sucralose – Splenda
These are really bad for you! They are chemicals made by the food industry as cheap alternatives to sugar. Research has shown that constant use of these sweeteners causes the bad stomach bacteria to multiply.  When this happens all sorts of disease can enter the body. There has been research linking diseases such as ME and MS to artificial sweeteners….how scary is that!
So many of them were added to foods when there was the ‘low fat is good for you’ phase; to make foods taste better, the manufacturers added sweeteners to low fad foods……. A recipe for disaster to our health. Keep away from ‘low fat no added sugar’ foods like the plague!
Sugar has lots of other names, so look out for anything containing glucose, high corn syrup etc. READ THE LABELS!
Here are a few healthier alternatives that you can use in place of refined sugar:
 
Xylitol….Tastes quite similar to sugar, but sweeter, you only need a small amount.
Dried monk fruit…..sweeter than sugar, the taste is pretty good.
Erythritol….another sugar alcohol which tastes OK!
Stevia…..this does have a bit of a funny aftertaste if you over do it!
More information:
Fructose is a toxin, it goes straight to the liver and produces high uric acid, fructose is bad for the kidneys
Research has shown that those who eat high fructose corn syrup tend to develop higher risk factors for cardiovascular disease within as little as two weeks.
