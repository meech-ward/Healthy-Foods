### As parents, carers or guardians, we are responsible for our children’s health. We watch them grow, pass all their milestones, get first teeth, start to walk and talk and then a lot of us allow them to eat sugary foods which are so harmful to them. In a recent survey in the UK it was discovered that by the age of 10, children exceed the maximum recommended sugar intake for an 18-year-old.
The recommended daily maximum of sugar for children aged four to six is five cubes or 19g. For children aged seven to 10 this rises to six cubes (24g) and up to seven cubes (30g) for those aged 11 and over.
However, UK children are consuming around 13 cubes or 52g of sugar a day, says PHE, based on results from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey.
Half of the sugar in children's diets comes from sugary drinks, sweets, biscuits, cakes, puddings, sugary breakfast cereals and higher-sugar yoghurts and puddings.
How can you reduce the amount of sugar a child eats daily?

Start the day with a boiled, scrambled, poached egg on seeded toast, or porridge with a splash of maple syrup.
Give your children coconut water, herbal teas, freshly squeezed fruit juices and water instead of sodas.
Give them delicious date bars instead of chocolate bars and sweets, when you want to give them a treat.
If you eat desserts, opt for fresh fruit, make a fresh banana smoothie, or almond flour pancakes (recipe)
Ensure they are eating fruit and vegetables everyday, give them a child’s probiotic and watch their coughs and colds disappear. Your child’s good health really does depend on what you choose to give them to eat. Once you have mastered that and get them to exercise every day, you will see healthier children.


### ADHD and ADD

When I was teaching in the US I was horrified at how many of my students had been prescribed ritalin for their hyperactivity or attention deficit….this drug has been classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule II narcotic—the same classification as cocaine, morphine and amphetamines. It’s possible side effects can be nervousness, insomnia, anorexia, loss of appetite, pulse changes, heart problems and weight loss. The manufacturer says it is a drug of dependency. Don’t you think that this should be a last resort drug after at least trying some dietary changes and supplements? In the UK over the past 10 Years the use of Ritalin and other ‘smart drugs’ has doubled. Almost 1.5 million prescriptions were dispensed by the NHS last year. Could this be that the increase in diagnoses has anything to do with the  foods our children are eating, which over the years are becoming more and more processed. My son, now aged 26 showed many signs of hyperactivity and attention deficit from the age of 2. I cut out all sugar and processed foods from his diet and introduced a high quality fish oil daily as well as a child’s probiotic. The probiotic is to make his tummy healthy and be ready to absorb all the fabulous nutrients. I made sure he had plenty of fresh air, burning off extra energy outdoors.This was enough to notice a huge difference in him. As he grew up into a teen, we had the help of a herbalist who introduced, a mix of gotu kola, pine bark and passion flower. Now as an adult, he has developed strategies to deal with the attention deficit, while continuing to eat a nutrient dense diet loaded with good fats. A study published in the British medical journal The Lancet indicated that in at least 2/3 of all ADHD cases, food sensitivities were the cause.
That’s a lot of kids  being dosed with toxic pharmaceutical drugs to treat ADHD who simply don’t need them! This number is colossal. In the U.S. alone, that represents an estimated 5 million children. The researchers from The Netherlands who discovered this, Dr. Lidy Pelsser and Professor Jan Buitelaar said;
"We think that dietary intervention should be considered in all children with ADHD. This, provided that parents are willing to follow a diagnostic restricted elimination diet for a 5-week period, and that expert supervision is available," 
So what are the food that have been shown to possibly cause and aggravate ADHD? Sugar, food additives and colours (read the labels of everything you buy). All processed foods (Anything in a tin or foods with a really long shelf life), some researchers believe fluoride can aggravate it too.
REMEDY  Cut out all processed foods eg bacon, sugar, sweeteners and foods from your child’s diet. Give them a high quality fish oil supplement daily as well as eating a diet high in healthy fats, proteins and vegetables. A magnesium supplement has shown to also have a calming effect and help with sleep. 
These were the types of meals I gave my son which improved his symptoms of ADD remarkably: I used organic ingredients where possible, butter and milk from grass fed cows, or coconut milk. I made sure my oils were cold pressed, extra virgin and organic.

Breakfast:
1. 2 eggs cooked any way from pasture raised hens with an avocado or organic toast. (some ADHD children have a sensitivity to gluten, so avoid bread if this is the case.) I have a fabulous recipe for gluten free Flatbreads (recipe) which I will share with you on the recipes page and only take 5 minutes to make and 5 minutes to cook.
2. Pancakes made with chestnut flour, egg and milk,(recipe) topped with berries and full fat organic yoghourt from coconut or grass fed cows.
3. Oatmeal with berries and sesame seeds, walnuts, add 1 oz. butter or coconut oil.
Drink: water and take high quality fish oil with breakfast.
Lunches:
1.Free range chicken with salad and  sweet potatoes. Pour extra virgin olive oil or extra virgin avocado oil over salad. With salt and pepper and lemon juice, or make homemade Mayonnaise (recipe)
2. Organic feta cheese with home made coleslaw(recipe) and flat bread.
3. Homemade cauliflower cheese, topped with tomatoes,(recipe) served with flatbread sprinkled with extra virgin olive oil.
Drink: water
Dinner:
1.Oily Fish, lightly fried with coconut oil or grilled, with sweet potatoes, leafy green vegetables, tomatoes, broccoli spears, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil.
2. Stir fry (coconut oil) of fish or chicken with bean sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, peppers, onions and garlic, with organic rice.
3. Pizza made with flatbread base, organic mozzarella and toppings of choice drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and served with veg or salad.
For desserts, I offered raw or cooked fruit with a sprinkle of coconut sugar or maple syrup, raw date and nut bars or almond flour cake. (recipe)
Drink: Water or sparkling water with a squeeze of fresh fruit.

NOTE: If your child is on medication for ADD or ADHD , consult with their doctor first about weaning them off these and substituting with nutrients and supplements.
