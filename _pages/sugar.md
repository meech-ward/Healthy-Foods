**SUGAR** is the main cause of illness in the western world. Why? It causes excess acid in the body. For those of you with heartburn or digestive issues, have you ever noticed how much worse it becomes after eating or drinking sugary foods or drinks?  If you can cut sugar out of your diet, you will lead a far healthier life. Nobody said life was easy and giving up sugar can be a nightmare, but it will be so worth it!  Sugar causes inflammation and disease thrives on inflammation. We know it can be really hard for some of you who are eating and drinking a lot of sugar, but start by cutting down, until you have cut it out completely. It is remarkable how much better you will feel! If you have been eating and drinking a lot of sugar for many years, you are not going to feel better immediately you give up, you will probably feel pretty bad until it is completely out of your system. It might take a few weeks,before you feel a lot better, but stick with it! See the big picture!

“Sugar’s not dangerous because of its calories, or because it makes you fat. Sugar is dangerous because it’s sugar. It’s not nutrition. When consumed in excess, it’s a toxin. And it’s addictive” Dr. Robert Lustig

Research shows that 40% of money spent on healthcare in the US alone are related to eating too much sugar. In the UK,  Obesity costs the NHS an estimated £5.1bn a year, research suggest that the rest of Europe is similar. Consuming too much sugar through your diet is closely associated with becoming overweight. That in turn increases the risk of some of the western world’s biggest killers: heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and certain cancers.  
 If you cut out sugar, inflammation will decrease. Not only that, but you will stop feeling tired from sugar crashes, your skin and hair will look better, you will sleep better.  But DON’T reach for the awful sweeteners, such as:

* **Saccharin** – Sweet’N Low, Sweet Twin, and Necta Sweet
* **Aspartame** – Equal and NutraSweet
* **Acesulfame K** – also in Equal and NutraSweet
* **Sucralose** – Splenda

These are really bad for you! They are chemicals made by the food industry as cheap alternatives to sugar. Research has shown that constant use of these sweeteners causes the bad stomach bacteria to multiply.  When this happens all sorts of disease can enter the body. There has been research linking diseases such as ME and MS to artificial sweeteners….how scary is that!
So many of them were added to foods when there was the ‘low fat is good for you’ phase; to make foods taste better, the manufacturers added sweeteners to low fad foods……. A recipe for disaster to our health. Keep away from ‘low fat no added sugar’ foods like the plague!
Sugar has lots of other names, so look out for anything containing glucose, high corn syrup etc. **READ THE LABELS!**

Here are a few healthier alternatives that you can use in place of refined sugar:
 
* **Xylitol…**.Tastes quite similar to sugar, but sweeter, you only need a small amount.
* **Dried monk fruit…**..sweeter than sugar, the taste is pretty good.
* **Erythritol…**.another sugar alcohol which tastes OK!
* **Stevia…**..this does have a bit of a funny aftertaste if you over do it!

More information:

* Fructose is a toxin, it goes straight to the liver and produces high uric acid, fructose is bad for the kidneys
* Research has shown that those who eat high fructose corn syrup tend to develop higher risk factors for cardiovascular disease within as little as two weeks.
