Optimise your health through lifestyle, exercise and nutrition.

I have been fortunate enough to grow up in a Royal Airforce family, travelling the world to each new posting! My palate has been tantalised with all the foods my parents cooked, which I brought into my adult life. Now, as a grandmother to 2 granddaughters who also love their foods, I hope to pass the love of healthy foods on to future generations.

Remember, you are responsible for your own health and as a parent you are responsible for your child’s health.  

Even if you are moderately aware of what to eat for good health, it is still so confusing trying to  figure out what to eat in order to remain or indeed get fit, and improve our health. When it comes to healthy foods, there is so much different  information out there that it’s difficult to know where to look for  advice. Happyhealthynut has researched for over twenty years, to bring you this advice: “What on earth can I eat?” With our team of nutritional therapists and founder Diana Ward, herself an educator and nutritional therapist, we are committed to bringing you the most up to date, well researched information to help you all lead healthier lives. Combine this with our tips on how to deal with an overload of stress, exercise guidance  and the importance of love and laughter, to optimise your health!

Choosing  foods that are full of nutrients which  will nourish, heal and support your health is one of the biggest steps towards living a healthy life. Indeed if you are suffering with a chronic illness, we hope that you can improve your quality of life by changing what you eat and drink and your lifestyle. 
Sadly, we have been brainwashed by nutrition labels claiming to be “all natural” and “fat free”, when in reality they are not healthy at all.
Read the labels of your “healthy” products and actually understand what is in them,
Since the 1980s there's been an explosion of low-fat products as we were told we needed to reduce the amount of saturated fat in our diets. It's true that fat supplies more than twice the calories per gram of carbohydrates, and saturated fat is the type of fat primarily responsible for clogging our arteries and increasing cholesterol levels. But, as we came to terms with this information, the food industry went full force into replacing the animal fats in their products with un-saturated vegetable oils. Some of the changes they had to make included altering the structure of the vegetable oil so it could be used in the place of solid fats. To do this the food producers used a process called hydrogenation.
Unfortunately, we now know these hydrogenated fats increase levels of dangerous trans-fats which are both bad for the heart and our cholesterol. UK supermarkets have been working hard to reduce levels of them in their products.
Enter SUGAR to make low fat products taste OK.

As well as altering the oils used for producing low-fat foods, manufacturers also found they had to increase the amount of sugar and/or artificial sweeteners in their products so we could enjoy their taste and texture.In actual fact, the typical low-fat product tended to be high in carbs, might contain trans-fats and loaded with additives. This high carb cocktail can lead to blood sugar swings and cravings making it more difficult to control our overall calorie intake. What we are hoping to teach you through our articles, blog posts and recipes. Is how to count nutrients, not calories, eat healthy fats and cut out sugar to make your lives happy, healthy and disease free.
