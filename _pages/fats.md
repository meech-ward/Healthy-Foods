We all need good fats in our diet. It’s an essential food needed for a smart and strong brain, cellular structure, hormonal balance, and so much more. Sadly we were informed that high fat was bad and we are still seeing ‘low fat’ yoghurt, milk, spreads, etc etc in supermarkets, advocating that this is healthy. IT IS NOT! Good fats prevent heart disease and cancer, it is sugar and refined carbs that we must stay clear of, as they cause inflammation that can lead to cancers and heart disease.

We need to eat the right kinds of fat, from high-quality sources, in order to truly reap its benefits.  Nutritionally, fats do more than simply supply calories. Certain fats, like those in avocado’s, walnuts, macadamia nuts and pecans and oily varieties of fish provide essential fatty acids (including the omega-3 variety). Add to this a high quality extra virgin Olive oil and you have a good range of fats to make your body healthy. These essential fats are important for maintaining healthy blood vessels, making hormones and for the correct functioning of our nervous system. The fat in our diet also helps us absorb certain vitamins, the fat-soluble ones, which include A, D, E and K. Following a very low-fat diet makes you more likely to be low in these vitamins and that can impact your immunity, limit the body's ability to heal itself and have an influence on bone health. 

It's better to focus your diet on the healthier fats by including more fish, nuts, olives and avocados and  extra virgin olive oil as well as grass fed butter. Coconut oil is a great source of high quality fat. A relatively new oil is MCT oil which is medium-chain triglycerides, a type of saturated fat that our bodies love. They’re easily digested and sent to the liver, where they can give your metabolism a kick-start; some people even add MCT oil to their morning drink because it helps you feel full, good if you are trying to lose weight.
 Steer clear from oils high in omega-6 fats (safflower, sunflower, corn, cottonseed, canola, soybean and peanut)

You can cut out all of your bad fats, immediately, however introduce the good fats slowly as your body becomes used to them. 

We drizzle extra virgin olive oil over salads and vegetables, add coconut oil to our berry smoothies, and use mct oil as a base for salad dressings. We also use grass fed butter on our homemade flatbreads.
