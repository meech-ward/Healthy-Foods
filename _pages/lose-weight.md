If you are overweight and have tried dieting, it’s time you changed your eating habits for ever. Fad diets work for a short period of time, however if you return to what you normally ate, you will just put the weight back on. What is required is a better understanding of foods and nutrients your body requires for good health. Once you have this knowledge, the weight will come off you and stay off. 

## Count Nutrients Not Calories:

Depending on how much weight you would like to lose, I would follow the tips below and watch your scales move down forever.

### Items to eat

* A probiotic and prebiotic supplement for good stomach health
* Psyllium husk
* Extra virgin, first cold pressed olive oil
* Butter from grass fed cows
* Extra virgin first cold pressed, organic coconut oil
* Organic extra virgin avocado oil
* Herbs and spices
* Himalayan salt
* Black ground pepper

* Pasture raised chickens and eggs from pasture raised chickens.
* Full fat organic yoghourt

* If you want to eat red meat, ensure it comes from grass fed cattle and only 100 grams per day.
* Organic bread, or if you have an allergy to gluten, almond flour and potato starch flatbreads (Recipe)
* Sweet potatoes
* All vegetables apart from Legumes and potatoes.
* Fermented vegetables (recipe)
* Avoid Nightshade vegetables as much as possible (Peppers,raw tomatoes, potatoes, aubergine) Cooked tomatoes are good.
* Organic rice (if you do not have a sensitivity towards grains)
* For your lunch and dinner ensure your plate is ¾ full of vegetables and ¼ with protein (Fish, eggs, cheese or meat) If you are vegan ensure the same 1/4 vegan * protein. You can have a small amount of carbs within your vegetable portion. (sweet potato, almond flour flatbread, organic rice)
* Try to eat the nuts raw and up to 75 grams a day.
* Drink 2 litres of filtered water a day as well as herbal teas and coffee.
* 1 small glass of red wine a day and 2 pieces of 70% cacao chocolate a day.

### Items to avoid

* Sugar: including any foods containing sugar (read the labels)
* Vegetable oils
* Fruit juices and sodas containing sugar.
* Sweeteners, apart from: xylitol, 
* Dried fruit (loaded with fruit sugar)
* Crisps
* Processed foods such as sliced bread, bacon, cured meats with nitrates, tinned food and long shelf life food.
* Margarines and anything containing margarine (pastries, biscuits etc.)

### Loosing the weight 

A fool proof, researched way of losing weight is to follow the above and try intermittent fasting, just for 16 hours to begin with. So for example if you eat your last food at 7 pm, you don’t start your next meal until 11am. In between these times, you can drink as many herbal teas, water and a couple of cups of coffee as you want. If you find it tricky to begin with, try 13 hours, then 14 etc.

Once that weight is off, it is so much easier to maintain and then you can introduce some treats, such as homemade ice cream,(recipe) almond flour cake(recipe) unpasteurised fresh orange juice, organic ale.

### A Typical Day

A typical day might consist of:

* 7 am Glass of filtered water
* As many herbal teas such as  green Matcha tea with a desert spoon of coconut or olive oil* 10.30am a teaspoon of psyllium husk in a glass of water.
* 11am A bowl full of blueberries, ground flaxseeds, sesame seeds, walnuts and a spoon of full fat yoghourt.
* Lunch: Sustainably caught fish with homemade coleslaw(recipe)and sweet potato.Water
* Evening meal: Broccoli spears, courgettes, carrots  and tomatoes with extra virgin olive oil drizzled over them with 100 grams of pasture raised chicken, grilled with seasoning.

Another one could be:

* 11am Home made flat bread and 2 pasture raised eggs cooked anyway you prefer.
* Lunch: Cauliflower cheese (recipe) with sweet potato wedges, and ratatouille(recipe)
* Evening meal: Chicken and rice salad (recipe)
* You can make great pizzas either using the flatbread recipe as your base or with mashed cauliflower as your base (recipes)
  - For those of you who enjoy Indian food. We eat curries at least once a week (recipe)
* If you need something for dessert, try berries with coconut cream.
  - Also flat bread with blueberries is amazing.
  - Almond flour cake (recipe)
* Snack on some raw nuts.

If you can incorporate this eating plan with some form of daily exercise, this will speed up the weight loss. 30 minutes fast walking a day is enough, but of course, go ahead and do as much exercise as you would like!
