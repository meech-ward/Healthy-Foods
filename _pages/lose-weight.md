You can do it
##If you are overweight and have tried dieting, it’s time you changed your eating habits for ever. Fad diets work for a short period of time, however if you return to what you normally ate, you will just put the weight back on. What is required is a better understanding of foods and nutrients your body requires for good health. Once you have this knowledge, the weight will come off you and stay off. 

COUNT NUTRIENTS NOT CALORIES:
Depending on how much weight you would like to lose, I would follow the tips below and watch your scales move down forever.

Items to eat
A probiotic and prebiotic supplement for good stomach health
Psyllium husk
Extra virgin, first cold pressed olive oil
Butter from grass fed cows
Extra virgin first cold pressed, organic coconut oil
Organic extra virgin avocado oil
Herbs and spices
Himalayan salt
Black ground pepper
Apple cider vinegar with the ‘mother’
Berries
Green bananas(Much less sugar than ripe bananas and contains probiotic)
Pecans
Walnuts
Pistachios
Sesame seeds
Flax seeds
Coconut milk
Cheese from grass fed cows, buffalo, sheep and goats
Sustainably caught fish
Pasture raised chickens and eggs from pasture raised chickens.
Full fat organic yoghourt
Full fat organic milk.
Homemade mayonnaise (recipe)
If you want to eat red meat, ensure it comes from grass fed cattle and only 100 grams per day.
Organic bread, or if you have an allergy to gluten, almond flour and potato starch flatbreads (Recipe)
Sweet potatoes
All vegetables apart from Legumes and potatoes.
Fermented vegetables (recipe)
Avoid Nightshade vegetables as much as possible (Peppers,raw tomatoes, potatoes, aubergine) Cooked tomatoes are good.
Organic rice (if you do not have a sensitivity towards grains)
For your lunch and dinner ensure your plate is ¾ full of vegetables and ¼ with protein (Fish, eggs, cheese or meat) If you are vegan ensure the same 1/4 vegan protein. You can have a small amount of carbs within your vegetable portion. (sweet potato, almond flour flatbread, organic rice)
Try to eat the nuts raw and up to 75 grams a day.
Drink 2 litres of filtered water a day as well as herbal teas and coffee.
1 small glass of red wine a day and 2 pieces of 70% cacao chocolate a day.

Items to avoid
Sugar: including any foods containing sugar (read the labels)
Vegetable oils
Fruit juices and sodas containing sugar.
Sweeteners, apart from: xylitol, 
Dried fruit (loaded with fruit sugar)
Crisps
Processed foods such as sliced bread, bacon, cured meats with nitrates, tinned food and long shelf life food.
Margarines and anything containing margarine (pastries, biscuits etc.)

A fool proof, researched way of losing weight is to follow the above and try intermittent fasting, just for 16 hours to begin with. So for example if you eat your last food at 7 pm, you don’t start your next meal until 11am. In between these times, you can drink as many herbal teas, water and a couple of cups of coffee as you want. If you find it tricky to begin with, try 13 hours, then 14 etc.

Once that weight is off, it is so much easier to maintain and then you can introduce some treats, such as homemade ice cream,(recipe) almond flour cake(recipe) unpasteurised fresh orange juice, organic ale.

A typical day might consist of:

7 am Glass of filtered water

As many herbal teas such as  green Matcha tea with a desert spoon of coconut or olive oil
10.30am a teaspoon of psyllium husk in a glass of water.

11am A bowl full of blueberries, ground flaxseeds, sesame seeds, walnuts and a spoon of full fat yoghourt.

Lunch: Sustainably caught fish with homemade coleslaw(recipe)and sweet potato.Water

Evening meal: Broccoli spears, courgettes, carrots  and tomatoes with extra virgin olive oil drizzled over them with 100 grams of pasture raised chicken, grilled with seasoning.

Another one could be:

11am Home made flat bread and 2 pasture raised eggs cooked anyway you prefer.

Lunch: Cauliflower cheese (recipe) with sweet potato wedges, and ratatouille(recipe)

Evening meal: Chicken and rice salad (recipe)

You can make great pizzas either using the flatbread recipe as your base or with mashed cauliflower as your base (recipes)
For those of you who enjoy Indian food. We eat curries at least once a week (recipe)

If you need something for dessert, try berries with coconut cream.
Also flat bread with blueberries is amazing.
Almond flour cake (recipe)

Snack on some raw nuts.

If you can incorporate this eating plan with some form of daily exercise, this will speed up the weight loss. 30 minutes fast walking a day is enough, but of course, go ahead and do as much exercise as you would like!

Flat bread: 
Equal amounts of Almond flour and potato starch flour,  1egg and liquid (Any type of organic milk, almond, coconut,etc, (add another egg if making a bigger amount) It lasts a few days in the fridge, keep in a jar with lid on.

Stir in the egg and milk to the flours until all lumps have gone. Make it as thick or runny as you prefer. Thicker(like a very thick batter mix) for naan type breads, thinner (like a thick pancake mix) for wraps. (experiment for best results)
Either lightly fry in coconut oil, or place on greased baking sheet and grill or bake, until lightly brown on both sides. 
You can use this as a pizza base, by making it even thicker.

You can add cheese and onion, garlic, tomato  to these for a more savoury bread. 
For a sweet bread, add blueberries, cinnamon and a dash of honey. Serve with coconut cream


Home made Mayonnaise:
300 ml. groundnut or avocado oil
2 egg yolks
1 garlic clove, crushed (optional)
1 heaped tsp powdered mustard or paste
1 level tsp salt
freshly milled black pepper
1 tsp white wine vinegar or lemon juice
Method
 Place the egg yolks into a bowl, add the crushed garlic, salt, freshly milled black pepper and the mustard powder. Mix all of these together well with a hand whisk or electric whisk then, holding the groundnut oil in a jug in one hand and an electric hand whisk in the other, add 1 drop of oil to the egg mixture and whisk this in.The key to a successful mayonnaise is making sure each drop of oil is thoroughly whisked in before adding the next drop. Once you've added about half of the groundnut oil, the mixture will begin to thicken and then you add the vinegar or lemon juice.Now you can add the remaining groundnut oil in larger drops. You can then begin pouring the olive oil in a very, very thin but steady stream, keeping the beaters going all the time. When all the oil has been added, the mayonnaise is ready. Store in a jar in the fridge.
Home made coleslaw
Red cabbage
Carrots
Raw beetroot
Celery

Grate equal amounts of cabbage and carrots. Add ¼ of the amount of grated raw beetroot and celery, add seasoning, extra virgin olive oil and homemade mayonnaise to taste. Can also add pine nuts, walnuts.


Almond flour cake
Serves: 8-1
approx. 375 grams clementines (approx. 3 medium-sized ones)
6 large eggs
75 grams of xylitol sugar
250 grams ground almonds
1 teaspoon baking powder (see NOTE below)
Put the clementines in a pan with some cold water, bring to the boil and cook for 2 hours. Drain and, when cool, cut each clementine in half and remove the pips. Dump the clementines - skins, pith, fruit and all - and give a quick blitz in a food processor (or by hand, of course). Preheat the oven to gas mark 5/190ºC/170°C Fan/375ºF. Butter and line a 21cm / 8 inch Springform tin.
You can then add all the other ingredients to the food processor and mix. Or, you can beat the eggs by hand adding the sugar, almonds and baking powder, mixing well, then finally adding the pulped oranges.
Pour the cake mixture into the prepared tin and bake for an hour, when a skewer will come out clean; you'll probably have to cover with foil or greaseproof after about 40 minutes to stop the top burning. Remove from the oven and leave to cool, on a rack, but in the tin.
